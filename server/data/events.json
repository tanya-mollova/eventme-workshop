    "description": "Do you own a cookbook you love but never use? Or cherished family recipes that could be creatively commemorated? What about that stack of old food magazines or restaurant menus you can’t seem to let go of? Join MOFAD for a community crafting workshop and transform those cookbooks and recipes into vibrant works of art. With guidance from multi-disciplinary artist and chef, Andrea Lekberg, we’ll chat about our favorite recipes and lean into our creativity at this hands-on collage workshop. We encourage you to bring physical cookbooks, recipes, food magazines, restaurant menus, or anything else you like! Don’t want to cut into a favorite piece? Bring a photocopy! MOFAD will also provide plenty of supplies for you to create for you to create your own cookbook collage to take home. Ticket includes access to Flavor: The World to Your Brain from 6 to 7 PM, baked goods from The Artist Baker, and beverages.",
